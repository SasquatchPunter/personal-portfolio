# Hello

In this repo is my personal portfolio project. It uses the following _JAMStack_:

- **CMS** - Contentful
- **Data Client** - graphql-request _lightweight graphql client_
- **Presentation Layer** - NextJS _for generating static HTML, and because its flavor of React is tight_

There are a few other bits mixed in, but these are what broadly make up the project. Enjoy looking through!
